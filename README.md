## Code Overview

The Sakura EA MT5 is an expert advisor (EA) designed for automated trading on the MT5 platform. It incorporates various strategies and risk management techniques to generate profitable trades while minimizing potential risks. Here is a brief overview of the code structure:

### Initialization Function (OnInit)

The `OnInit` function is called during the initialization phase of the expert advisor. Any code for initialization should be added here.

### Deinitialization Function (OnDeinit)

The `OnDeinit` function is called when the expert advisor is being removed from the chart or the platform is closed. Any code for deinitialization should be added here.

### Tick Function (OnTick)

The `OnTick` function is called for each tick received by the expert advisor. Any code for tick handling should be added here.

### Start Function (OnStart)

The `OnStart` function is the main function where the actual trading logic is implemented. The following features are incorporated in the code:

- Classic trade strategy based on intraday trend levels: The code implements a classic trade strategy based on intraday trend levels to identify potential trading opportunities.
- Breakout strategy: The code utilizes a breakout strategy to generate profitable trades.
- Risk management: Risky strategies like martingale or grid systems are not used to ensure the safety of trades.
- Stop Loss (SL) and Take Profit (TP): Separate Stop Loss (SL) and Take Profit (TP) levels are provided for each order to manage risk and maximize profits.
- News Filter: The code incorporates a built-in News Filter function to prevent opening new orders during important news releases. This helps to avoid potential market volatility.
- Lot size options: Traders have the option to choose between fixed lot sizes or lot sizes proportional to their account balance.
- Risk and capital management: A risk and capital management regime is implemented to protect the trader's capital and manage risk effectively.
